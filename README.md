# PRODIGY_ML_04
I have developed a hand gesture recognition model to identify and classify hand gestures based on Task-04: "Develop a hand gesture recognition model that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data, enabling intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems." The goal was to create a system that enables intuitive human-computer interaction through gesture-based controls.

# Dataset
The dataset used was the LeapGestRecog dataset from Kaggle. It contains images of different hand gestures, which were used to train and evaluate the model.
Here is the dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gti-upm/leapgestrecog?select=leapGestRecog

# Steps for using the dataset
1. Download the directory from the above given website link.
2. Upload them to your drive in a folder called Datasets to make things easier.
3. Then open Google Colab.
4. Add a Code cell above the given code in the ipynb file to mount your Google drive.
5. Then use the code given in the .ipynb file.

# Code Execution
The code is inside the SVM_Cat_vs_Dog_Classification.ipynb file. Run the cells after mounting the drive.

# Knowledge Gained
**1. Data Preprocessing:** I mastered the process of loading and preprocessing image data, including resizing images and converting them to grayscale to streamline the input for the model.
**2. Data Handling:** I learned how to preprocess image data by converting it to grayscale, resizing it for consistency, and encoding labels for machine learning.
**3. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** I designed and implemented a CNN architecture to effectively classify hand gestures. This included configuring convolutional and pooling layers for feature extraction.
**4. Model Training:** I practiced training a deep learning model, adjusting parameters, and monitoring its performance to ensure it learned effectively.
**5. Evaluation and Optimization:** I gained insights into evaluating model performance using accuracy and loss metrics and understood the importance of model validation.
**6. Saving Models:** I learned how to save and load trained models, making them reusable for future tasks or deployment.
